1) improve movement input/controls

2) rework map/graphics system

3) build enemy combat behavior

4) create special moves and logic for selecting them

5) The clearing thing doesn't work right now because I don't want it to clear the combat history. Like the map and the dialogue should be opened in seperate terminals
